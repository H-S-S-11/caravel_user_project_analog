## Mixed signal tests
Collection of analog and mixed signal test circuits.

Basic goal: a comparator based on the circuit in "CMOS Design" (Jacob Baker).

Extra goals:
-A small array (eg 1x8) of Flash cells for characterisation
-An alternative comparator layout using only self-biased amplifiers (no bias voltage required)
-The digital section of delta-sigma ADC
-Demo charge pump
-Sample-and-hold circuit

Refer to [README](docs/source/index.rst) for the sample project documentation.
